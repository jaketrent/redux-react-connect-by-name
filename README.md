# redux-react-connect-by-name

A redux connector that allows you to:

- Name your reducers and actions
- Reuse a general selector for your reducer

This has a few benefits of:

- Have your action creators bound to dispatch for you
- Not requiring you to specify a new selector for every component you want to connect to the redux store
- Have consistent namespacing for components that connect to multiple reducers' state
- Keeping the component file clean of selector construction
- Create a convenient location in the reducer to expose derived state
